# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) - Market Analysis

## Executive Summary

The GEO venture operates at the intersection of **search engine optimization (SEO)** and **generative AI**. This emerging industry is often dubbed *"Answer Engine Optimization" (AEO)* or *"Generative Engine Optimization"*, reflecting a shift from ranking on traditional search to appearing in AI-driven answer engines.

## 1. Rise of AI Answer Engines

### The Fundamental Shift

A growing number of users are **skipping Google search** and going directly to AI chatbots to get answers:
- ChatGPT
- Bing Chat
- Perplexity
- Claude
- Google Gemini

Instead of receiving a list of links, users now receive **direct, conversational responses**.

### Market Impact

**Traffic Predictions:**
- Traditional search usage could drop **~25% in the next few years**
- Organic web traffic might be **cut in half by 2028** due to AI answers
- Google's AI-driven Search Generative Experience (SGE) alone could slash publishers' search traffic by **20% to 60%**

**Business Risk:**
Businesses not included in AI-generated answers risk losing:
- Visibility
- Traffic
- Revenue
- Brand awareness

This macro shift is forcing marketers to re-think how they ensure their content is surfaced by AI engines, not just search engines.
