# Mini Business Plan - Creed

## Executive Summary

**Company:** Creed
**Industry:** MarTech / SEO / AI Optimization

**The Opportunity:**
AI search engines (ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Perplexity) are disrupting traditional search. Websites risk losing 25-60% of traffic if not optimized for AI. Current solutions are either too expensive (enterprise) or non-existent (SMB). Creed fills this gap.

Three light-lift services that help businesses ensure AI search engines see, understand, and cite their content:
1. AI Visibility Health-Check (€1,700-€4,300)
2. Schema & Labels Fix-Up (€130-€260/page)
3. 24/7 AI Mention Alerts (€860-€2,600/month)

**Traction Goal:**
- Month 3: 100 customers, €5k MRR
- Month 9: 500 customers, €30k MRR
- Month 18: 2,000 customers, €100k MRR
